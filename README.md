# Robot-Assembly-Modified-Eye-and-Tablet
This repository is for three robot tasks, collect and assemble the robot parts, design the eye, and design the tablet area.

In this repository there are six STL files. The first STL file is for assembly, there are 35 parts was collected together and assembled,
to get out with the robot shown in the STL file called "Robot Full Body". The second STL file is for the design of the robot eye, as it 
shown in the STL file named "Eye Piece 01" it was designed to let the light appear as much as it can, the third STL file called "Eye LED" 
this file just for the light installed inside the "Eye Piece 01", these two parts was assembled and installed inside the first STL file 
"Robot Full Body" and get out with new assembly to the robot shown in the fourth STL file called "Robot Modified Eye". The fifth STL file 
is about the design of the Tablet area, the STL file name is "Tablet Design" it is installed above the eyes in the middle hole, and it 
came out with the sixth STL file named "Robot with Tablet". Also, in the design of the tablet the wire area was taken into account.
